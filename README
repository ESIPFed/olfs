Server4 is a new data server which combines the efforts at UCAR/HAO to build
a high performance DAP-compliant data server for the Earth System Grid II
project with existing software developed by OPeNDAP. The server is intended
to be a replacement for the existing 3.x servers which OPeNDAP is distributing.

The new server uses the Java servlet mechanism to hand off requests from 
general web daemon to DAP format-specific software. This results in higher
performance for small requests. The servlet front end, which we call the 
OPeNDAP Lightwieght Front end Server (OLFS) looks at each request and
formulates a query to a second server (which usually runs on te same machine as
the OLFS) called teh Back End Server (BES). The BES is the high-performance 
server software from HAO. It's handles reading data from data stores and 
returning DAP-compliant responses. The OLFS may return those with little or
no modification or it may use them to build more complex responses. The nature
of the Interprocess Communication (IPC) between the OLFS and BES is such that 
they should both be on the same machine or be able to communicate over a very
high bandwidth channel.

See the NEWS file for news about the latest release.

See the INSTALL file instructions on getting, building and running the server.
